## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the redesigned **B.Draddy** online store — the premium golf apparel and accessories brand under Summit Golf Brands.

- Developed as a 100% custom Shopify theme starting from a blank slate (Online Store 2.0)
- No reliance on Dawn, Impulse, Prestige, Broadcast, or any other published/premium theme
- All templates, sections, snippets, assets, styles, and scripts were hand-coded
- Goals: modern luxury golf aesthetic, high-performance UX, fast loading, brand storytelling, and seamless shopping experience for golf enthusiasts
